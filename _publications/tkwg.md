excerpt: 'The KnowWhereGraph aims to address the challenge of data integration by building a large-scale, cross-domain, pre-integrated, FAIR-principles-based, and AI-ready data warehouse rooted in knowledge graphs. We highlight the design principles of KnowWhereGraph, emphasizing the roles of space, place, and time in bridging various data "silos".'
